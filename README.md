## Autolib electric car-sharing service company
* We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.
* We need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then - perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.
* An example of claim to test would be:
  * "Is the number of Bluecars taken in area X different than in area Y?
  * Is it greater in area X than in area Z? Etc‚Äù.
  * The selected periods of interest be either weekdays or weekends but not a mix of both.
